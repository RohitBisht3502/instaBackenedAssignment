## Overview

The Instagram Management Application is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to help manage Instagram information. It allows users to perform various operations related to user management, including adding new restaurants, updating specialties, and deleting restaurants from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for the following operations:

1. **Get All User:** `GET /restaurants`
   
   This endpoint retrieves a list of all registered restaurants.

   ```java
   @GetMapping("user")
   public List<User> user() {
       
   }
   ```

2. **Get user by ID:** `GET /user/{id}`

   This endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific restaurant by its ID.

   ```java
   @GetMapping("user/{id}")
   public Restaurant getRuser(@PathVariable Integer id) {
      
   }
   ```


   ```

3. **POST image:** `POST /image/{id}`

   This endpoint post a image by its ID.

   ```java
   @PostMapping("user/{id}")
   public String postRestaurant(@PathVariable Integer id) {
       
   }
   ```

### Services

The Services layer implements the core business logic, data processing, and interaction with the data repository. Key responsibilities include:

- Validating input data.
- Performing CRUD operations on user data.
- Handling data transformations and interactions with external systems (if applicable).

### Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the underlying database. It handles database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for restaurant data. Additionally, it may include data mapping and conversion between Java objects and database entities.

## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

### ArrayList

The project

 utilizes the `ArrayList` data structure to store and manage lists of `user` objects in various parts of the application. `ArrayList` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing restaurant records and performing operations on them.

These data structures enable the application to organize and manipulate restaurant data efficiently while maintaining data integrity.

## Project Summary

The user Management Application is a robust Spring Boot application designed for efficient user data management. It offers a set of RESTful API endpoints for various restaurant-related operations, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user and post information.

Key Features:

- RESTful API endpoints for restaurant management.
- Data validation to ensure data integrity.
- Clean code separation with a layered architecture (Controller, Services, Repository).
- Robust error handling for improved reliability.
- Java-based backend and Maven for build management.

The user Management Application serves as a practical example of Spring Boot application development, demonstrating best practices in API design and restaurant data management. It offers a solid foundation for building and extending restaurant management systems in various applications.
